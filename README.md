On-premise security camera control, recording, and motion detection via OpenCV

Posted this for a friend to review - this is not my best work and has some hacks I'm not excited about.

Requires FFMPeg binary executive and OpenCV installed.  .NET Core.

Provides internal website which shows live view of all cameras, zoom on one camera, latest motion on all cameras, motion history (for retention period), and provides control to turn off and on cameras.

Can email motion alerts, and upload them to a remote SFTP server.
